# Out Air Pollution Project  
**2 Arduino boards were used having 4 sensors on each of them.**    
**DHT sensor** - For measuring Humidity and Temperature  
**Pm sensor**  - For measuring particulate matter (pm2.5  & pm10 )  
**Gas sensor** - For measuring 3 gases (CO ,NH2 ,NO2 )  
**GPS**        - To keep record of the locations where we were measuring.
